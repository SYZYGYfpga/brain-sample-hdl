# Syzygy Brain-1 Helloworld

Simple "hello world" FPGA design for the SYZYGY Brain-1 that runs a counter on
the LEDs.

This sample also serves as a reference design. By importing the block design
from this sample into a new project and maintaining the same Zynq PS
configuration the new project will be compatible with the Opal Kelly Linux
image.
